This project implements a minimalistic version of Neural Style Transfer (NST) using PyTorch


## Sample Outputs
Below are some sample outputs generated by this implementation. The left image is the content, the middle is the style, and the right is the generated image.

<p float="left">
  <img src="content.png" width="50%" />
  <img src="grid.png" width="50%" /> 
</p>

## Customization
You can adjust various parameters in the excecution to experiment with different aspects of style transfer, such as:
- Number of iterations
- Style weight
- Content weight
- Learning rate
